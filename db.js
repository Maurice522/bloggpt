    para : ['Satta, also known as "matka gambling", is a form of betting and gambling that originated in India. It involves betting on the opening and closing rates of cotton, which were transmitted to the Bombay Cotton Exchange from the New York Cotton Exchange via teleprinters. The game quickly evolved and expanded to include betting on other markets and sports.',
            'Satta is illegal in many countries, including India, and is often associated with organized crime. Despite its illegal status, the game continues to be widely popular, particularly in cities like Mumbai and Delhi.',
            'The game is played by choosing a number, which is then placed into a pot. The pot is then opened at a certain time, and the number that is drawn is the winner. The winning number is determined through a process that is often shrouded in secrecy, and is typically controlled by a group of individuals known as "satta king" or "matka king".',
            'Participants in satta have to pay a fixed amount to the satta king or the bookie and in return, they will get a number. They will place their bet on that number. The winning numbers are usually based on the opening and closing rates of cotton, but can also be based on other markets or sports.',
            'Satta is a highly addictive and dangerous game, as it can lead to financial ruin and even criminal activity. It is not only illegal, but also morally reprehensible. It is a form of gambling that preys on vulnerable individuals and can lead to serious financial and personal problems.',
            'Satta is often associated with organized crime and money laundering, as the illegal proceeds from the game are often funneled into other criminal activities. Moreover, the game is often associated with violence, as disputes over winnings or losses can turn violent.',
            'In conclusion, Satta is a highly illegal and dangerous form of gambling that should be avoided at all costs. It not only ruins the life of the individual who is participating in it but also creates negative impact on the society. It is important to stay away from such illegal activities and instead, invest your time and money in more productive and legal pursuits.']
